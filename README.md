## Versiones

- V1.1
 
 Made by Mildred. Base of the interface. Buttons, graphs and inputs are added. Without modification to code.
 
- V1.2

 Made by Sergio. Code for the animation of the buttons. Specify the lists according to the type of methods selected. Without modification to interface.
 
- V1.3

 Made by Ovidio. Code for the animation of the lists. Specification of the inputs according to what is required of the selected method. Without modification to interface.
 
- V1.4

 Made by Naomi. Code for the animation of tables. Creation of modifiable tables to input inputs, adabtable to the necessary amount. Tables and a spinner are added.
